[English](README.md) | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README_zh.md)

## Project Overview
**Rim Farm** is an innovative hydroponic farming project, integrating intelligent control technology, designed to allow people to grow vegetables and fruits in almost any environment.

### Project Background
As globalization progresses, the vulnerability of food supply chains has become increasingly apparent. Sudden events such as natural disasters, pandemics, or political conflicts can disrupt traditional agricultural production, leading to food shortages. At the same time, rapid urbanization has distanced many people from traditional agriculture, making it harder to access fresh, safe, and healthy food. **Rim Farm** ensures that vegetables and fruits can be grown reliably even in extreme conditions.

### Key Features

- **Green & Low-carbon**: Uses renewable energy sources like solar and wind power
- **Smart Control**: Features advanced automation and sensor systems
- **Cost-effective**: Uses affordable and easily available materials
- **Adaptable**: Works in various environments (indoor/outdoor)
- **Community-focused**: Enables collective farming projects

### Future Outlook
The **Rim Farm** project will continue to evolve, focusing on reducing costs, improving technology, and achieving full automation. Through ongoing innovation, we aim to address global food crises and promote sustainable agriculture.
